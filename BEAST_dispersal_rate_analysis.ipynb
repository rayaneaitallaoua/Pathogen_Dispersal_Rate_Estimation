    "## How is the dispersal rate estimation by BEAST affected by sampling area and dispersal model?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates how the **sampling area** and the **underlying dispersal model** influence the accuracy and variability of dispersal rate estimates inferred by BEAST using continuous phylogeographic diffusion models.\n",

    "### 1. GSpace simulation using various sampling areas\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate sequence data under controlled spatial population genetic conditions using GSpace. The key variable in this notebook is the **sampling radius** \\( r \\), which defines the sampling area.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling area:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling area is defined as a square located at the center of the lattice with area:\n",

    "\\[\n",
    "A = 2r^2\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- A larger \\( r \\) results in a broader spatial coverage.\n",
    "- A smaller \\( r \\) means more spatially restricted sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We vary \\( r \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\} \\), keeping the total number of sampled individuals constant across runs.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Lattice size: 20 Ã— 20\n",
    "- Individuals per node: 30\n",
    "- Sampled individuals: 20 (5 per node)\n",
    "- Chromosome: 1, 1000 bp\n",
    "- Mutation model: HKY\n",
    "- Dispersal model: uniform, maximum distance = 1\n",

    "To assess whether **increasing the sampling area**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increases the precision or bias of **diffusion rate estimates**.\n",
    "- Improves the correlation between true and estimated movement distances."
