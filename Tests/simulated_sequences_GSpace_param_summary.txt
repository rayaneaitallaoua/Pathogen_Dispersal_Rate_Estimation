Number of simulated data sets : 1
Number of chromosomes / independant loci : 1
Number of linked sites / loci per chromosome : 1000
Mutation model : hky
Mutation rate : 1e-05
Recombination rate : 0
Sample size X : 1
Sample size Y : 1
Number of sampled individuals per node :
 5(2,14)
Total number of sampled individuals : 5
Ploidy : 1
Lattice size X : 20
Lattice size Y : 20
Edge effects : reflecting
Number of individuals per lattice node : 30

Forward axial dispersal distribution (step, prob) : 
0	             0.95
1	             0.05

Forward axial dispersal mean (within dist_max) : 0.05
Theoretical sigma2 without bounds : inf
Forward axial dispersal sigma2 (within dist_max) : 0.05
Forward axial dispersal skewness (within dist_max) : 1
Forward axial dispersal kurtosis (within dist_max) : 17

If kurtosis/skewness appears wrong there may be many reasons
   It may be because the dispersal distribution is not
   computed with enough precision.

Dsigma2 (within bounds) : 1.5

Expected slope (within bounds) : 0.333333333333333 (1D) or 0.106103295394597 (2D).

Cumulative forward axial dispersal distribution on both dimensions (move, prob) : 
-1	            0.975
0	             0.95
